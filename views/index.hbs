            I am Nicolas (Nic) Howe. Computer and game enthusiast.
        </h1>
        <h2>
            Currently studying computer science at New York University
            through the Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences.
            Additionally, I study game design and creative writing also
            through NYU.
        </h2>
        <h2>
            I've been in love with computers since I was a small child
            curiously searching the internet to figure out how they worked.
            I self-taught myself programming throughout high school and did
            work on rudimentary games in my spare time.
        </h2>
        <h2>
            Additionally, I've been writing short stories and poetry since
            elementary school, and have carried that through to university.
            Examples of my work can be found on this very site!
        </h2>
        <h2>
            I have been playing guitar for six years and bass for two years.
            I have released professionally recorded material with a band and
            am currently working on self-produced material.
        </h2>
        <h2>
            I am an experienced web developer and game developer. I have
            worked both by myself and with a team using agile workflow tools.
